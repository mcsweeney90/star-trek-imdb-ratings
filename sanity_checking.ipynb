    "# How well do IMDb ratings reflect Star Trek fan consensus?\n",
    "\n",
    "The IMDb rating of a Star Trek episode represents the average score out of 10 given by the IMDB users who chose to rate it. Therefore it is interesting (for certain definitions of the word!) to consider how well these ratings reflect the Star Trek fandom consensus as to which episodes are the best and worst. Of course, we would expect that most of the people who review these episodes are Star Trek fans, especially since none of these shows have aired new episodes for many years. Still, there may be unexpected patterns...\n",
    "\n",
    "IMDB reviewers may or may not be typical of your average Star Trek fan, but the real issue with any kind of online reviews is brigading: people/bots deliberately giving high, or low, ratings in order to influence opinion. This especially tends to be the case with things that are controversial, with unhappy fans sometimes being much more likely to give negative reviews. This is one of the reasons that I decided not to include the Discovery-era Star Trek shows in this analysis, as these have split fan opinion and I can't really intuit the relative size of the different factions; certainly there's a vocal group of fans that hate them, but it's not clear to me whether they're truly more numerous than fans with a more positive opinion or just louder. (For what it's worth, I fall somewhere in the middle. I dislike Discovery and think it was a complete mess from the off; Spock has a secret sister, come on! Picard I thought was much promising in its first season, before an atrocious second. Lower Decks I tried and couldn't really get into, but I'm not a great fan of animation and it did seem to be a genuinely affectionate parody, so I can chalk that up to \"just not my thing\". Prodigy and Strange New Worlds I haven't seen yet; the former doesn't really appeal to me, and the latter hasn't aired in the UK yet.)      \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, let's see how well the ratings reflect (my surely biased interpretation of!) the fan consensus as to which episodes of each series are the best and worst. Note that as this is inherently subjective, we start with Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG), as that is the series that I am most familiar with."

    "Again, reasonable - these are bad, poorly-regarded episodes on the whole. It's also interesting to note that the three worst-rated episodes are decisively so, especially *Shades of Gray*. This jives with the fandom consensus; unlike the rest of the bad episodes, which are usually just boring and can be safely ignored, these provoke stronger reactions in many fans: *Shades of Grey* is a clipshow with almost no new footage, *Code of Honor* is often regarded as racist, and *Sub Rosa* is just plain crazy, approaching \"so bad it's good\" territory. One last thing to note: on the whole these episodes have fewer votes than the top ten (more on this later).    "
